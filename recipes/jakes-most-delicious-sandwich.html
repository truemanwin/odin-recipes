    <h3>Jake's most delicious sandwich is, according to Jake, "the greatest sandwich ever made."</h3>
    <p>Jake required instruction by the realm of creation in order to know how the sandwich would be conceived.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Baguette</li> 
            <li>Cream cheese</li>
            <li>Pickles (from Prismo)</li>
            <li>Dill</li>
            <li>Diced boiled eggs</li>
            <li>Bird (from the window)</li>
            <li>Sliced cucumbers</li>
            <li>Sliced Roma tomatoes</li>
            <li>Sweet yellow onions</li>
            <li>Tears (for salt)</li>
            <li>Meat prepared sous-vide with rosemary and thyme</li>
            <li>Bacon</li>
            <li>A lobster's soul</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Vacuum seal the meat with rosemary and thyme. Place it into a 135 degree sous vide.</li>
            <li>Now we start preparing the sandwich. Cut the baguette into halves and toast it accordingly (oven or blowtorch, your choice!)</li>
            <li>Spread cream cheese on both sides.</li>
            <li>Now on one side, sliced pickles from that boy Prismo, and some dill on the other side.</li>
            <li>"Yeah baby, now we're rolling," grab the nearest bird from a window, debone, and broil it respectively.</li>
            <li>Back to the sandwich, diced boiled eggs and the bird from the window.</li>
            <li>Top it with slices of common cucumbers, Roma tomatoes, and sweet yellow onions (organic of course).</li>
            <li>Almost done. Tears, salt to taste, the meat sous vide from earlier, and slices of bacon.</li>
            <li>For the most important part of all, lobster soul. Of course if you have make to adjustments, Babish has an excellent substitute solution using lobster aioli.</li>
        </ol>
