    <h1>Beef Tips and Tots</h1>

    <h2>Recipe by Chef John</h2> 
    <p>I'm going to show you this very old-school method of making beef tips, which, once made, can be used to top lots of things—but my favorite thing to top with tips is probably Tater Tots®. 
        And if you're looking for new ways to prepare lean, cheap, tough cuts of beef, this is one of my all-time favorite methods. 
        You can give this an upgrade by topping with diced red onion, grated Cheddar cheese, and freshly sliced green onions, or you can serve the beef tips over hot mashed potatoes instead of tots, if you like.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ pounds beef round steak</li> 
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 ¼ cups low-sodium beef broth</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) package frozen bite-size potato nuggets (such as Tater Tots®)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the sour cream into the bowl and gently mix it until soft. Add the whipped topping and gently mix it into the sour cream until you have a smooth base for your ambrosia.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat until shimmering. Transfer in beef, arranging in a single layer. Let the meat sear until browned, 3 to 5 minutes, before turning over and browning the other side.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium and add tomato paste, garlic, and butter. Stir everything until the butter melts, and then stir in the flour. Cook and stir for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Stir in broth. Raise heat to high and bring to a simmer. Reduce to low, cover, and cook until beef is starting to get tender, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Uncover, turn heat to medium, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened, and the meat is tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>While meat simmers, bake potato nuggets in the preheated oven until crispy and heated through, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Taste beef tips and adjust the seasoning. Serve immediately over hot potato nuggets.</li>
        </ol>
